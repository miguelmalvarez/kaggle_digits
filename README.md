# kaggle_digits
Code repository to solve the Kaggle Digit Recognition Challenge in python. 

To Run the script, first you should download the train and test CSV files from the Kaggle competition and store them in the folder data. After this, run the command "python src/run.py". This will generate a file results.csv in the data folder with the output of the best selected model. This file can be submitted directly to the competition.

Some of the steps and decisions of this code have been discussed in my blog www.miguelmalvarez.com and it is still a work in progress.
