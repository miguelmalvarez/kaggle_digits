# kaggle_digits
Code repository to solve the Kaggle Digit Recognition Challenge in python. 

To Run the script, first you should download the train and test CSV files from the Kaggle competition and store them in the folder data. After this, run the command "python src/run.py". This will generate multiple results files based on different configurations with the output of the best selected method for each one of them. These files will be produced in the data folder and can be submitted directly to the competition.

The system also creates a relatively detailed log with the outputs of all the stages of the optimisation process.

Some of the steps and decisions of this code have been discussed in my blog www.miguelmalvarez.com and it is still a work in progress. Feedback or PRs are welcome.
